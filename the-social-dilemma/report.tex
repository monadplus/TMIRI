%If you are not paying for the product, you are the product.

%Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

%"Social media is a drug, we have the biological neeed to connect with other people"

%No regulation on adv for kids e.g. Youtube Kids

%Each technology brings a new level of manipulation: newspaper, television, social media ..

%Algorithms are opnions embed in code.

%Center of human technology

%"Everyone in your news feed sounds just like you. Once you are at that state, it is easy to manipulate you. Like magicians"

%Polarization in USA politics by manipulation.

%Youtube algorithm is a rabbit hole. Algorithm recommends the most engaging videos.

%Example: Pizzagate

%The system is biased towards false information. False information makes companies make more money.

%Government weaponizing social media.

%Myanmar cellphones are sold with a facebook account and ppl only know how to use facebook. Manipulation leed to 700.000 Rhingya Muslims to flee the country

%Manipulation of election by social media.

%Democracy for sell.

%"We only watch channels that say we are right."

%Society is unable of healing itself.

%"Civil war"

%"How do you wake up of matrix when you don't know you are in matrix"

%"I think we need to accept that it's okay for companies to be focused on making money. What's not okay is when there are not regulation, no rules, no competition and the companies are acting as sort of de facto governments".

%What an oxymoron! After the "The Social Dilemma" finished, Netflix was recommending me a new tv show!
